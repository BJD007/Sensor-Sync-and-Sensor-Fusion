# Multiple-Radars



This code does the following:
Sets up ROS subscribers for multiple 77GHz radars (assuming three radars in this example).
Uses message_filters.ApproximateTimeSynchronizer to synchronize incoming radar messages.
Implements a simple sensor fusion algorithm using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
Processes and fuses data from multiple radars in the radar_callback method.
Publishes the fused radar data.
To use this code:
Save it as a Python file (e.g., radar_fusion.py) in your ROS package's scripts directory.
Make the file executable: chmod +x radar_fusion.py
Add the following line to your package's CMakeLists.txt:
text
catkin_install_python(PROGRAMS scripts/radar_fusion.py
  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})

Build your ROS package: catkin_make
Run the node: rosrun your_package_name radar_fusion.py
Note that this is a simplified example and you'll need to adapt it to your specific radar hardware, message formats, and fusion requirements. The pointcloud2_to_array and array_to_pointcloud2 methods are placeholders and should be implemented based on your actual PointCloud2 message structure.
Additionally, you may want to enhance the fusion algorithm based on your specific needs, potentially incorporating more advanced techniques like particle filters or machine learning approaches for more robust radar data fusion
